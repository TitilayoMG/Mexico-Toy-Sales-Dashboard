## Introduction
This sales analysis dashboard was analyzed on Power BI. The dataset used is a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys which include information about products, stores, daily transactions, and current inventory levels at each location. The dashboard is titled ‘Maven Toys Sales Dashboard’.

This project shows my ability to create dashboards with well-defined KPIs to provide a clear and measurable way to assess performance. I was able to align the dashboard with the organization's strategic objectives by highlighting the most critical metrics that directly contribute to business goals.

## Problem Statement
The goal of the analysis is to 
* Identify product categories that drive the biggest profits and verify if it is the same across store locations
* Discover seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data if there’s any
* Detect if there are lost of sales with out-of-stock products at certain locations
* Ascertain the amount of money tied up in inventory at the toy stores and determine the period it will last.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was found on maven analytics data playgroung. You can get the dataset and other dataset ![here](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=6&pageSize=5)

## Skills and Concept Demonstrated
Power BI Concepts like;
* Transforming and cleaning data using Power Query Editor.
* Merging tables to combine data from multiple sources.
* Creating DAX functions for aggregation, filtering, and calculations.
* Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations
* Designing dashboard for a cohesive view of key performance indicators.
* Translating business requirements into dashboard specifications.
* Data visualization

## Data Transformation
Imported the file into Power BI through Text/CSV then clicked on 'Tranform Data' and added other datasets into Power Query Editor.
I transformed the data in Power Query, checked for Colum quality and consistency of data types
Merged inventory and product table to calculate the cost of inventory as it’s only product table that contains the amount
Also in Power Query, I merged sales and product table to get sold product and some business calculations.

## Data Analysis 
On Power BI, created measures using DAX. Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI or Metrics.

## Data visualization
The dashboard highlight the key Performance Indicators. It shows the total revenue the company generated all through the financial year, the profit, total cost incurred, number of stores, number of product categories, the quantities of product sold and total number of product sold.
