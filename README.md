## Introduction
This is sales analysis dashboard analyzed on Power BI. The dataset used is a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys which include information about products, stores, daily transactions, and current inventory levels at each location. The dashboard is titled ‘Maven Toys Sales Dashboard’.
This project shows my ability to create dashboards with well-defined KPIs to provide a clear and measurable way to assess performance. I was able to align the dashboard with the organization's strategic objectives by highlighting the most critical metrics that directly contribute to business goals.

## Problem Statement
The goal of the analysis is to 
* Identify product categories that drive the biggest profits and verify if it is the same across store locations
* Discover seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data if there’s any
* Detect if there are lost of sales with out-of-stock products at certain locations
* Ascertain the amount of money tied up in inventory at the toy stores and determine the period it will last.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was found on maven analytics data playgroung. You can get the dataset and other dataset ![here](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=6&pageSize=5)
